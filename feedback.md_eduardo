Changes that need to be made: 
- Always remember to captalize "Python"
- 2nd paragraph in the "First Things First", syntax is wrriten as sintax
- Inside "Printing in Python", it is written programm instead of programm
- Try to make divisions between topics, use: ---
- Inside "What is a function", it is written parethesis instead of parenthesis
- Inside "What is a function", it is written serail instead of serial
- Try putting key words or concepts in bold: **word**
- Try adding multiple challenges to test the user
Basically focus on grammer and make a little more organized, like adding a table of contents
