That`s because through print we can explain the most basic concepts in python syntax: what is a function, how text is interpret by the computer in python, and what are variables.

    "Everytime you see a word in yellow followed by parethesis, that will most likely be a function. Functions are essentially a little machine that is proggramed to do something with whatever is inside its parethesis. In this case print will be the equivalent of the computer checking what's inside the parethesis, and returning it to the user is text form, also called in many platforms \"serail monitor\", which is return to the user (or in programming world, output) uin form of characters (abc123!@# etc).\n",

In this case \"Hello, World\" is actual english text, that the computer doesn't really \"understand\". You can think of it as whatever is inside the quotation marks, doesn`t become relevant to the program, the computer will only \"copy and paste it\"to where the text is needed. This type of text is called string, and you will later be able to underst it and its difference from other sequences of characters in your code.\n",
